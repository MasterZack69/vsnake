# Why?
So on Feb 20, 2026 was my last exam. I had thought that I would spend a few days completely resting. But as soon as I woke up on Feb 21, I was super bored. I installed Batman Arkham Asylum and played it for an hour, but I was still bored. I watched some anime later, yet again I was bored.
I wanted to do something. I needed to do something. I had heard praises about multi-agent workflow for vibe coding. With nothing to do, I thought why not.

# What again?
It is a vibe-coded recreation of the famous snake game (if that's what it is called, 'snake game'). This project was solely made to kill my boredom and test out multi-agent workflow.
